	 <p> <h3>Masud Rana is a fictional character created in 1966 by writer Qazi Anwar Hussain, who featured him in 460+ novels. Hussain created the adult spy-thriller series Masud Rana, at first modeled after James Bond, but expanded widely. So far 463 books have been published in this series which has gained a lot of popularity in Bangladesh. Written from the 1960s and continuing to present day, books are published almost in every three months by Sheba Prokashoni, one of the most popular publishing house of Bangladesh. Although Qazi Anwar Hussain started the series, he doesn't write it any more. A group of ghostwriters are employed to produce all the new Masud Rana novels. </h3></p>
